EagleEye XFlow 🦅🌐

Real-Time Network Forensic Engine & Intelligent Network Analysis Tool

📖 Overview

EagleEye XFlow is a real-time, AI-assisted network forensic and analysis engine built to inspect and analyze traffic across L2–L7 of the TCP/IP stack. It enables researchers, security analysts, and network engineers to capture, fingerprint, and investigate live network flows with high efficiency and minimal latency.

Designed for both forensic research and practical intrusion detection workflows, EagleEye XFlow provides structured datasets for behavior analysis, anomaly detection, and performance benchmarking.
